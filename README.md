# Ryan McCormick

**Machine Learning Engineer @ Bedrock Research** • **CS @ Stanford**  
I build geospatial ML systems: foundation-model embeddings, unsupervised clustering, anomaly/rare-object detection, and tooling for production-ready applications.

## What I’m best with

- **Cross-modal Foundation Models** — embeddings across optical, SAR, and thermal; unified latent spaces; zero/low-label workflows.  
- **Unsupervised Tooling** — HDBSCAN pipelines, cluster-quality metrics, radar-plot diagnostics, CLI for large-scale embedding jobs.  
- **Anomaly & Rare-Object Detection** — sliding-window + target-similarity scoring; fast iteration on large overhead datasets.

## Selected Work

- **Latent Spaces: Seeing Inside an AI Brain** — Blog post and demos on unsupervised geospatial modeling  
  https://www.bedrockresearch.ai/latent-spaces-seeing-inside-an-ai-brain
- **(Soon to be published 2nd blogpost, not public yet)**
- **Embedding & Clustering Suite (Bedrock)** — modular metrics (incl. density-aware), visualizations, CLI, containerized.
- **Anomaly Detection Pipeline (Bedrock)** — unsupervised scoring + human-in-the-loop exploration.
- **Metadata Search for Massive Datasets** — SQL schema + fast geo filtering (country/lat-lon), Overture + Google Maps integration.
- I have my name as a co-author on a few papers (see my resume for a detailed list), but I have yet to write my own study independently. I wouldn't be surprised if that changes by the end of this year.

## Public Projects

- **Self-Balancing Robot (WIP)** — RL + mechatronics sandbox  
  Repo: https://github.com/Giantryan484/Balancing-Robot
- **TabGenerator.app** — audio → playable guitar tabs  
  Repo: https://github.com/Giantryan484/Guitar-TAB-Generator · Live: https://tabgenerator.app/
- **Mini-Projects** — small tools and experiments (lots of tiny wins)  
  Repo: https://github.com/Giantryan484/Mini-Projects
- **Frisbee Drone (Big WIP)** - Not ready to be shown off quite yet, but I'm intermittently working on a CV system for tracking thrown frisbees and retrieving them with a drone.
  Repo: None, yet

> Many of these are from my time in high school and have been abandoned in states of ~60% functionality because I had such an experimentation-oriented brain at the time. Please give me a chance to prove my coding abilities beyond this mess.

## Tech I use

**Python**, **PyTorch**, TensorFlow/Keras • **Docker**, AWS, Google Cloud • **HDBSCAN**, scikit-learn, numpy/pandas • **Raster/SAR tooling** (sarpy, tif stacks)
Full-stack when needed: JS/HTML/CSS, React/SvelteKit, SQL · Git, Bitbucket, CI/CD

**Certs**: TensorFlow Professional Developer · SolidWorks Expert (top <1%)

> I'm also very familiar with C++ and Java through the courses I've taken here at Stanford. I just haven't found use for them in any of my ML projects yet.

## Highlights

- Built & shipped **unsupervised geospatial ML tooling** used in client-facing deliverables.  
- Designed **containerized CLIs** to abstract away the complexity of cluster visualization and analysis.  
- Created **anomaly & rare-object detectors** that performed across SAR/optical without labels.  
- Wrote externally-facing technical content and presented to **government and industry audiences**.

## A Note About My Future

Right now I'm focusing on my studies at Stanford. Don't expect regular updates to all of this; I'm only able to work in between problem sets and over summer break. My coursework is quite comprehensive, covering everything from standard DSA to more detailed courses in fully-autonomous robotics and safe + reliable AI systems. I'm very early in my career and I'm prioritizing a strong base and foundation in AI research before I dive into industry head-on. So, even though I might not have as flashy products as others at Stanford, you can be sure I'm one of the hardest workers and quite a breeze to solve the world's toughest problems beside. If Stanford let me in for that merit, you can be certain your company would love it just as much.

If you think I'd be a good fit for one of your projects, tell me now! There's a risk I could be bought out of school some time in the not-so-far future. Hope we can get in touch!
