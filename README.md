# Ryan McCormick

**Machine Learning Engineer @ Bedrock Research** • **CS @ Stanford**  
I build geospatial ML systems: foundation-model embeddings, unsupervised clustering, anomaly/rare-object detection, and tooling for production-ready applications.

## What I’m best with

- **Cross-modal Foundation Models** — embeddings across optical, SAR, and thermal; unified latent spaces; zero/low-label workflows.  
- **Unsupervised Tooling** — HDBSCAN pipelines, cluster-quality metrics, radar-plot diagnostics, CLI for large-scale embedding jobs.  
- **Anomaly & Rare-Object Detection** — sliding-window + target-similarity scoring; fast iteration on large overhead datasets.

> “From all of us at Bedrock: best of luck, Ryan… you’ve set the bar high.” — *Matt Reisman, CTO, Bedrock Research*

## Selected Work

- **Latent Spaces: Seeing Inside an AI Brain** — Blog post and demos on unsupervised geospatial modeling  
  https://www.bedrockresearch.ai/latent-spaces-seeing-inside-an-ai-brain
- **(Soon to be published 2nd blogpost, not public yet)**
- **Embedding & Clustering Suite (Bedrock)** — modular metrics (incl. density-aware), visualizations, CLI, containerized.
- **Anomaly Detection Pipeline (Bedrock)** — unsupervised scoring + human-in-the-loop exploration.
- **Metadata Search for Massive Datasets** — SQL schema + fast geo filtering (country/lat-lon), Overture + Google Maps integration.
- I have my name as a co-author on a few papers (see my resume for a detailed list), but I have yet to write my own study independently. I wouldn't be surprised if that changes by the end of this year.

## Public Projects

- **Self-Balancing Robot (WIP)** — RL + mechatronics sandbox  
  Repo: https://github.com/Giantryan484/Balancing-Robot
- **TabGenerator.app** — audio → playable guitar tabs  
  Repo: https://github.com/Giantryan484/Guitar-TAB-Generator · Live: https://tabgenerator.app/
- **Mini-Projects** — small tools and experiments (lots of tiny wins)  
  Repo: https://github.com/Giantryan484/Mini-Projects 
- **Frisbee Drone (Big WIP)** - Not ready to be shown off quite yet, but I'm intermittently working on a CV system for tracking thrown frisbees and retrieving them with a drone.   
  Repo: None, yet
- **Personal Website - ryanmccormick.dev (Soon to be published)** - I'm going a bit over-the-top with my website design to practice my frontend skills. So, there's a lot of assets I need to make beyond my traditional programming tasks. It could be a while before I get this looking good.   
  Repo: None, yet

> Many of these are from my time in high school and have been abandoned in states of ~60% functionality because I had such an experimentation-oriented brain at the time. Please give me a chance to prove my coding abilities beyond this mess.

## Tech I use

**Python**, **PyTorch**, TensorFlow/Keras • **Docker**, AWS, Google Cloud • **HDBSCAN**, scikit-learn, numpy/pandas • **Raster/SAR tooling** (sarpy, tif stacks)
Full-stack when needed: JS/HTML/CSS, React/SvelteKit, SQL · Git, Bitbucket, CI/CD

**Certs**: TensorFlow Professional Developer · SolidWorks Expert (top <1%)

> I'm also very familiar with C++ and Java through the courses I've taken here at Stanford. I just haven't found use for them in any of the projects I've worked on yet.

## Highlights

- Built & shipped **unsupervised geospatial ML tooling** used in client-facing deliverables.  
- Designed **containerized CLIs** to abstract away the complexity of cluster visualization and analysis.  
- Created **anomaly & rare-object detectors** that performed across SAR/optical without labels.  
- Wrote externally-facing technical content and presented to **government and industry audiences**.

## A Note About My Future

Right now I'm focusing on my studies at Stanford. Don't expect regular updates to any of these projects or documentation; I'm only able to work in between problem sets and over breaks. My coursework is quite comprehensive, covering everything from standard DSA to more detailed courses in fully-autonomous robotics and safe + reliable AI systems. I'm very early in my career and I'm prioritizing a strong base and foundation in AI research before I dive into industry head-on. So, even though I might not have as flashy products as others, you can be sure I'm one of the hardest workers and quite a breeze to solve the world's toughest problems beside. If Stanford let me in for that merit, you can be certain your company will love it just as much.

> If you think I'd be a good fit for one of your projects, tell me now! As a freshman I'm flying under the radar of most companies. At the risk of being egotistical, you should get in touch with me before I'm a senior engineer you'll have to pay 10x as much.
